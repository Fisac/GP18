## OBS Setup
- Download OBS from [here](https://obsproject.com/) and follow [this](https://obsproject.com/wiki/OBS-Studio-Quickstart) guide on how to set it up and getting started.

- There is a known problem when you record on a laptop using a Nvidia GPU. If something isn't working, try following [this guide](https://obsproject.com/wiki/Laptop-Troubleshooting#for-nvidia-based-laptops).

### Before you start recording.
- Make a list of everything you want to show in the trailer; gameplay, graphics, mechanics etc.
- You want to keep the trailer between 30 seconds to a minute long, so keep that in mind.


## Assignment

1. Start your project and record some gameplay! Record as much as possible and do multiple takes so you have more material to work with later on.
2. Find a song you want to use for your trailer and download it. (YouTube has some [free music](https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music) you can use).
