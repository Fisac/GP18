## DaVinci Setup
- Download DaVinci from [here](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/) and follow [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbqmZjJEsBw) guide to get started.

### Workspaces
In DaVinci Resolve you will work in different workspaces which are all displayed at the bottom of the screen. It's natural to start at the far left at "Media" and work your way to the right until you finally reach "Deliver".

The workspaces are in order:
- [Media](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/media) - Here you import videos, images and sounds that you want to use in your project.
- [Edit](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/edit) - Here you cut together the media you have imported.
- [Fusion](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/fusion) - This is a new workspace introduced in DaVinci Resolve 15 where you create visual effects.
- [Color](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/color) - Here you tweak the color settings of the project.
- [Fairlight](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/fairlight) - This is where you tweak and edit sounds.
- [Deliver](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/media) - Here you render and export the project.

### Cutting video
- Now for the video, this is the most time consuming and fun part of the project. You want to cut out only the relevant and exciting parts of the video. You want the first five seconds to be as eye-catching as possible, if it isn't, people WILL scroll by and ignore the trailer. It's hard to say what exactly you should cut out, you have to figure that out yourself depending on what type of trailer you want to make. However, the things you want to focus on are gameplay and features. People should have an understanding of what your game is and should be interested enough for people to wanna play it.
- A rule you can go by is using a maximum of 3-5 seconds for each shot, example: Show the player attacking for 3 seconds, cut to next part of character swimming for 4 seconds, cut to the next part of a boss battle for 5 seconds. It might seem like a very short amount of time for each section but using my example we have already covered 12 seconds which is almost half the trailer.
